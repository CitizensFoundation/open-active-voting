          <li>Voting will be open to those of secondary school age and above.</li>
          <li>Votes can be cast for ideas in one Ward.</li>

          <li>The election takes place on a website where citizens authenticate themselves securely (by inputting 6 digit postcode). Votes will be encrypted and can therefore not be traced to individuals.</li>
