  votes_about_areas_text: "<h1>About Better boroughs</h1>   <p>Better boroughs is a citizen participation project on minor new construction and maintainance projects in Reykjavík's boroughs and is partly hosted on the online citizens portal Better Reykjavík. Projects are built on citizen's ideas about improving the local environment and increase the chances for people to get together and engage in various outdoor activities, ideas that create better opportunities for play or recreation and ideas that encourage cycling or improve facilities for pedestrians and bus passengers. </p>  <h1>Ideas and budget</h1><p> In order to submit ideas and participate in the online consultation you have to be registered as user at Better Reykjavík. Registered users gain access to Better boroughs automatically. For this purpose the City of Reykjavík offers access to computers at public libraries and borough centres. The total budget for these borough projects is 300 million ISK. This amount is distributed between boroughs, partly as a fixed amount and partly according to population.</p>  <h1>Submitting ideas</h1> <p> Citizens of Reykjavík could submit ideas to Better Reykjavík - Better boroughs and engage in consultation for these minor borough projects between October 7th and November 8th 2014. Ideas were sent to a team of technical experts (architects, engineers etc.) for feasibility and price evaluation, after which each of the 10 borough councils prepared a list of up to 20 projects for people to vote on. </p>  <h1>Online vote</h1><p> Citizens of Reykjavík can vote on the projects online from 00:01 on Tuesday February 17 until 00:00 of Tuesday February 24 on a website made specially for the occasion. Citizens can vote in a borough of own choice, regardless of where in the city they live, but only in one borough. Voting is limited to those born 1998 or earlier and who are legal residents in Reykjavík on the day they vote.
