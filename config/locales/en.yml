  <b>Picking projects for the baskets</b><br>
                          Below each basket you will find a list with
                          up to 13 projects you can choose from by
                          clicking on them. When a project is selected
                          the line with it’s name will darken. The project
                          will now appear in the basket above the list.
                          Those projects you can no longer afford will
                          now turn grey. You are no longer able to
                          select them.
                          <br><br>
                          The numbers below the basket show how
                          much money you have spent and how much
                          money you have left to spend. You can
                          continue picking projects into the basket until
                          you run out of money or until there is not
                          enough money left for any of the remaining
                          projects (which will then turn grey).

                          <b>Hugmyndir fjarlægðar og nýjar valdar</b><br>
                          Til að fjarlægja hugmynd úr körfu smellirðu
                          aftur á viðkomandi hugmynd. Hún hefur
                          nú verið fjarlægð og aftur er hægt að velja
                          þær hugmyndir sem á ný rúmast innan
                          fjárhagsrammans (þær eru ekki lengur gráar
                          og fá sinn upphaflega lit). Á þennan hátt
                          geturðu valið og fjarlægt hugmyndir – allt
                          þangað til þú ert reiðubúin(n) að kjósa.

                          <b>I’m not able to use all the money. Is my vote still valid? What about the rest?</b><br>
                          It may happen that you will not be able to
                          use the whole budget. This will e.g. happen
                          when you can’t afford any of the projects you
                          still haven’t chosen. You don’t have to worry
                          about this. You can still vote and your vote
                          is still valid. The price tags for the projects
                          are not entirely accurate and it is therefore
                          likely that some small amounts of money will
                          shift between projects as they are realized.
                          Such transfers will however be confined to
                          respective neighbourhoods and categories.

                          <b>Click the Vote button – vote is received</b><br>
                          When you are finished selecting projects into
                          one or both baskets simply click the Vote
                          button. You will then be diverted to a page
                          that will confirm that your vote has been
                          received with the following message: Your
                          vote has been received.

                          you want while the poll is still open. Just
                          remember that only your newest vote will
                          count.
