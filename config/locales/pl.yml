<h1>About the vote</h1><p>
The voting system is electronic and is operated as an independent unit at Reykjavík City’s IT Centre. Users enter through the website Betri Reykjavík. The system is developed by the Citizens Foundation for the City of Reykjavík in collaboration with Registers Iceland and Ísland.is. Inhabitants can vote on up to 26 projects in a neighbourhood of their own choice, but only in one neighbourhood.</p>




<h1>What are we voting on?</h1><p>
Voting occurs in two categories: new construction projects and maintenance projects. You can choose between up to 13 projects in each category. Every project has a price tag. You can choose as many projects as you want into each ‘basket’, until the maximum limit for that basket has been reached – or until there is no room left for those projects that have not yet been chosen. The vote dictates the final choice of projects in Reykjavík’s neighbourhoods for the year 2012.</p>






<h1>
Can I vote?</h1><p>
Voting participation is limited to those who turned 16 years old by the end of 2011 and are registered inhabitants in one of Reykjavík’s neighbourhoods on the day they vote. In order to see how you are registered at Registers Iceland simply look yourself up in the My pages section on the site Ísland.is Use your Icelandic ID number and password or electronic authentication with a debit card. You can also access these information through your online bank service.

<p>For further information and assistance please call 4 11 11 11 to talk with one of our service representatives at Reykjavík City‘s Service Centre.</p>

                                          <em>Betri hverfi</em> (Better boroughs) is part of the website <em>Better Reykjavík</em> and is an open platform for citizen consultation on minor new construction projects and maintainance projects in Reykjavík’s neighbourhoods. The website was open for ideas that can improve the local environment and increase the chances for people to get together and engage in various outdoor activities, ideas that create better opportunities for play or recreation and ideas that encourage cycling or improve facilities for pedestrians and bus passengers.




                                          <h1>Ideas and budget</h1><p>
                                          In order to submit ideas and participate in this kind of  consultation you had to be registered as user at Better Reykjavík. Registered users gained acces to Better boroughs automatically. For this purpose the City of Reykjavík offers access to computers at public libraries and neighbourhood centres. The total budget for these neighbourhood projects is 300 million ISK. This amount is distributed between neighbourhoods, partly as a fixed amount and partly according to population.</p>





                                          <h1>Submitting ideas</h1>
                                          <p>Citizens of Reykjavík could submit ideas to Better Reykjavík – Better boroughs and engage in consultation for these minor neighbourhood projects between 5 December 2011 and 23 January 2012. Ideas were subsequently sent to a team of specialists (architects, engineers etc.) for feasibility and price evaluation, after which each of the 10 neighbourhood councils prepared a list of up to 26 projects for people to vote on.</p>





                                          <h1>Online vote</h1><p>
                                          Citizens of Reykjavík can vote on the projects online between March 29 and April 3 on a website made specially for the occasion. Citizens can vote in a neighbourhood of their own choice, regardless of where in the city they live, but only in one neighbourhood.</p>

  <h1>Rules
  </h1>
  <p ><b>1.  About the vote</b></p>
  <p>The  voting system is electronic and is operated as an independent unit at  Reykjavík City&rsquo;s IT Centre. Voters enter through the website  &ldquo;Betri Reykjavík&rdquo;<em>. </em>The  system is developed by the Citizens Foundation for the City of  Reykjavík in collaboration with Registers Iceland and Ísland.is.  Inhabitants can vote on up to 26 projects in a neighbourhood of their  own choice, but only in one neighbourhood.</p>
  <p >Voting  occurs in two categories: &ldquo;New construction projects&rdquo; and  &ldquo;Maintenance projects&rdquo;. You can choose between up to 13 projects  in each category. Every project has a price tag. You can choose as  many projects as you want into each &lsquo;basket&rsquo;, until the maximum  limit for that basket has been reached – or until there is no room  left for those projects that have not yet been chosen. The vote  dictates the final choice of projects in Reykjavík&rsquo;s  neighbourhoods for the year 2012.</p>
  <p ><b>2.  Time and date of the vote</b></p>
  <p>Citizens  of Reykjavík can vote on the projects online from 12 a.m. on March  29 until 4 a.m. on April 4. The vote will thus remain open for four   open until 4 a.m. on April 4. This is done to avoiding overloading  the system and make sure that everyone can finish voting.</p>
  <p ><b>3.  Language</b></p>
  <p>The  voting site and information about the vote will be available in  Icelandic, English and Polish. The Icelandic version applies should  there arise any uncertainties about these rules. </p>
  <p ><b>4.  Eligibility to vote</b></p>
  <p>To  vote in the elecection voters must be legally registered in Reykjavík  on the day they cast their vote and have had reached the age of 16 by  the end of the year 2011. Registers Iceland will confirm true age and  residence of voters as they cast their vote.</p>
  <p >Voters  can check their registration at &ldquo;Mínar síður&rdquo; on the website  Ísland.is. To use &ldquo;Mínar síður&rdquo; voters must log in with their  personal ID number and a webkey, or with an electronic ID on a  debitcard. Voters can also find this information with the help of  their online personal banking services.</p>
  <p ><b>5.  Polling stations</b></p>
  <p>The  voting occurs through the website <a href='http://www.kjosa.betrireykjavik.is'>kjosa.betrireykjavik.is</a>.  The vote is not a &lsquo;ballot&rsquo; according to Icelandic law as there  are no actual polling stations where secrecy of the vote is  guaranteed by vote monitors. The level of secrecy and security of the  vote is therefore up to the individual voter and depends e.g. on how  well he guards his password and that he votes in such a way that  other people are prevented from seeing.</p>
  <p >Reykjavík  City&rsquo;s Service Centres offer access to computers and will assist  those who so require with voting. For further information see article  11. on &bdquo;Assistance with voting&ldquo;<em>.</em></p>

  <p><b>6.  Electronic authentication – permanent webkey</b></p>
  <p>Voting  occurs through an online voting system where voters authenticate  themselves in a secure way and where the vote is encrypted. The vote  cannot be traced back to the voter.</p>
  <p> <b>6.1  Ísland.is</b></p>
  <p>Voters  are authenticated through the service-site Ísland.is.  Registers Iceland will confirm true age and residence of voters as  they cast their vote.</p>

  <p><b>6.2  Permanent webkey in an online bank or at the tax office</b></p>
  <p>Those  who already are using Ísland.is  can simply use their current webkey to log in. New users can create  an access at Ísland.is  and have their webkey sent to their online bank or with post to their  permanent residence. If a webkey from the Internal Revenue  Directorate (Ríkisskattstjóri) is lost, voters can have a new one  immediately sent to their online bank. See Skattur.is – &bdquo;Týndur  veflykill.&ldquo;</p>
  <p >Webkeys  can also be acquired in person, upon identification at the nearest  tax office. In order to use the key voters must log into the site  Skattur.is and make it permanent.<b> </b>See  also article 11 – &bdquo;Aðstoð við kosningu.&ldquo;</p>
  <p ><b>7.  Login and authentication</b></p>
  <p>When  you have chosen <a href='http://www.kjosa.betrireykjavik.is'>kjosa.betrireykjavik.is</a> you will see the first page of the voting site &ldquo;Better Boroughs.&rdquo;  Here you will see a link (logo) to to the authentication site  Ísland.is.</p>
  <p ><b>7.1  Ísland.is</b></p>
  <p>When  you click the Ísland.is button you will be directed to an  authentication site. Here you have two options for authentication:  using a debitcard with a built-in electronic ID or using a permanent  webkey provided by the Internal Revenue Directorate  (Ríkisskattstjóri).</p>
  <p ><b>7.2  Electronic ID</b></p>
  <p>You  put your debitcard into a card reader that is connected to your  computer/device and click the button &ldquo;Lesa skilríki.&ldquo;</p>
  <p><b>7.3  Password</b></p>
  <p>You  enter your ID number and a permanent password provided by the  Internal Revenue Directorate (Ríkisskattstjóri) and click the  &ldquo;Staðfesta&ldquo; button. The password is a so called permanent  password. This means that you have to change the password provided by  the Internal Revenue Directorate and choose your own personal  password on the site Skattur.is. Other passwords, such as unchanged  passwords, company passwords or passwords for paying tax or VAT are  NOT VALID for authentication.</p>
  <p >If  you need help with providing a password, to log in, or to vote,  please call 4 11 11 11 or use the web-chat at</p>
  <p><a href='http://www.reykjavik.is'>www.reykjavik.is</a> to talk with one of our service representatives at Reykjavík City&lsquo;s  Service Centre.</p>
  <p >You  can also ask for assistance with login and voting at any of  Reykjavík&rsquo;s Neighbourhood Service Centres. Rules on the assistance  can be found in article 11 - &ldquo;Voting assistance&rdquo;.</p>
  <p ><b>8.  &lsquo;Ballot&rsquo; and voting</b></p>
  <p ><b>Choose  a borough</b></p>
  <p>When  you have authenticated yourself at the site Ísland.is you will be  directed to the &lsquo;Choose a borough&rsquo; page. On this page you will  see a map of Reykjavík where each borough has been given it&rsquo;s own  colour. Choose the borough you want to vote in by clicking it on the  map.</p>
  <p > <b>Find  my borough </b></p>
  <p>If  you are not sure what borough you live in, or if you want to explore  other boroughs, you can find out by clicking &ldquo;Find my borough&rdquo;  above the map. This will open, in a new window, the Reykjavík Land  Information System website. There you can browse through street names  and see which streets belong to which borough.</p>
  <p ><b>Two  baskets: </b><b>New  construction projects and maintenance projects</b></p>
  <p>The  ballot is divided into what you might call two shopping baskets: &lsquo;New  construction projects&rsquo;<em> </em>to  the left and &lsquo;Maintenance projects&rsquo;<em> </em>to  the right. In order to make full use of your ballot you should select  projects into both baskets. You can cast your vote by clicking the  &lsquo;Vote&rsquo;<em> </em>button,  even though you have not filled the baskets or left one of them  empty. Your vote will still be valid.</p>
  <p ><b>Further  information about the projects</b></p>
  <p>Should  you require further information about the projects you can click on  the question mark that is located behind each project name. This will  open a new window with a short description of the project.</p>
  <p ><b>Selecting  projects for the baskets</b></p>
  <p>Below  each basket you will find a list with up to 13 projects you can  choose from by clicking on them. When a project is selected the line  with it&rsquo;s name will turn blue. The project will now appear in the  basket above the list. Those projects you can no longer afford  will  now turn grey. You are no longer able to select them.</p>
  <p ><b>Continue  selecting until basket is full or until not enough money is left</b></p>
  <p>The  numbers below the basket show how much money you have spent and how  much money you have left to spend. You can continue selecting  projects into the basket until you run out of money or until there is  not enough money left for any of the remaining projects (which will  then turn grey).</p>
  <p ><b>Adding  and removing projects</b></p>
  <p>In  order to remove projects from the basket, simply click the project  name again. The project will be removed and leaves room to add other  projects. Those projects that now again fit the budget are no longer  grey and will turn blue. In this way you can select and deselect  projects – until you are ready to vote.</p>
  <p align='justify'><b>I&rsquo;m  not able to use the whole sum. Is my vote still valid?</b></p>
  <p>It  may happen that you will not be able to use the whole budget. This  will e.g. happen when you can&rsquo;t afford any of the projects you  still haven&rsquo;t chosen. You do not have to worry about this. You can  still vote and your vote is still valid. </p>
  <p><b>Click  the &lsquo;Vote&rsquo;</b><em><b> </b></em><b>button  – vote is received</b></p>
  <p>When  you are finished selecting projects into one or both baskets simply  click the <em>Vote </em>button<em>. </em>You  will then be diverted to a page that will confirm that your vote has  been received with the following message: Your vote has been  received.</p>
  <p ><b>Vote  as often as you like – only the newest vote will count</b></p>
  <p>You  can repeat this process as often as you want while the poll is still  open. Just remember that only your newest vote will count.</p>
  <p ><b>9.  Counting votes</b></p>
  <p > Votes  are counted as follows:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>All  	votes in respective categories and boroughs are counted and projects  	listed according to the number of votes they have received.  </p>
    </li>

    </li>
  </ol>
  <ol start='3'>
    <li>
      <p>The  	second most popular project is selected and compared to what is now  	left of the budget. If the project fits the budget it is selected  	and put on the list after the first one.

      <br />

                           On this page you see a map of Reykjavík where each borough has been given it’s own colour. Choose the borough you want to vote in by clicking it on the map.</p>



                           <h1>Find my borough </h1><p>
                           If you are not sure what borough you live in, or if you want to explore other boroughs, you can find out by clicking <strong>Find my borough</strong>  above the map. This will open, in a new window, the Reykjavík Land Information System website. There you can browse through street names and see which streets belong to which borough.

  votes_help_get_ballot: "
 <h1>Two baskets: New construction projects and maintenance projects</h1>
 <p>The ballot is divided into two baskets: New construction projects to the left and Maintenance projects to the right. In order to make full use of your ballot you should select projects into both baskets. You can cast your vote by clicking the Vote button, even though you have not filled the baskets or left one of them empty. Your vote will still be valid.</p>


 <h1>More information about the projects?</h1><p>
 Should you require more information about the projects you can click on the question mark that is located behind each project name. This will open a new window with a short description of the project.</p>


 <h1>Selecting projects for the baskets</h1><p>
 Below each basket you will find a list with up to 13 projects you can choose from by clicking on them. When a project is selected the line with it’s name will turn blue. The project will now appear in the basket above the list. Those projects you can no longer afford  will now turn grey. You are no longer able to select them.</p>

 <p>The numbers below the basket show how much money you have spent and how much money you have left to spend. You can continue picking projects into the basket until you run out of money or until there is not enough money left for any of the remaining projects (which will then turn grey).</p>



 <h1>Adding and removing projects</h1><p>
 In order to remove projects from the basket, simply click the project name again. The project will be removed and leaves room to add other projects. Those projects that now again fit the budget are no longer grey and will turn blue. In this way you can select and deselect projects – until you are ready to vote.</p>



 <h1>I’m not able to use all the money. Is my vote still valid? What about the rest?</h1><p>
 It may happen that you will not be able to use the whole budget. This will e.g. happen when you can’t afford any of the projects you still haven’t chosen. You don’t have to worry about this. You can still vote and your vote is still valid.</p>



 <h1>Click the Vote button – vote is received</h1><p>
 When you are finished selecting projects into one or both baskets simply click the Vote button. You will then be diverted to a page that will confirm that your vote has been received with the following message: Your vote has been received.</p>

 <h1>Vote as often as you like – only the newest vote will count</h1><p>
 You can repeat this process as often as you want while the poll is still open. Just remember that only your newest vote will count.</p>
